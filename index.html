    <p><strong>Open source</strong> is a source code that is made freely available for possible modification and
        redistribution. Products
        include permission to use the source code,[1] design documents,[2] or content of the product. It most commonly
        refers to
        the open-source model, in which open-source software or other products are released under an open-source license
        as part
        of the open-source-software movement. Use of the term originated with software, but has expanded beyond the
        software
        sector to cover other open content and forms of open collaboration.</p>

        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The term "open source", as used to describe software, was first proposed by a group of people in the free
            software
            movement who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software"
            and sought
            to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.<sup>[3]</sup> Moreover, the
            ambiguity of the term "free
            software" was seen as discouraging business adoption.<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> The group included
            Christine Peterson, Todd Anderson, Larry
            Augustin, Jon Hall, Sam Ockman, Michael Tiemann and Eric S. Raymond. Peterson suggested "open source" at a
            meeting<sup>[6]</sup>
            held at Palo Alto, California, in reaction to Netscape's announcement in January 1998 of a source code
            release for
            Navigator. Linus Torvalds gave his support the following day, and Phil Hughes backed the term in Linux
            Journal. Richard
            Stallman, the founder of the free software movement, initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed
            his
            mind.<sup>[7]</sup> Netscape released its source code under the Netscape Public License and later under the
            Mozilla Public
            License.<sup>[8]</sup></p>
